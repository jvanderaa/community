## Nautobot Community Meetings

Nautobot Community Meetings are held in [NTC Slack](https://slack.networktocode.com) in the `#nautobot` channel.


### Schedule

Meetings will be held the last Thursday of every month starting September 30, 2021 at 11:30am Eastern.

### Meetings on the Issue Tracker

Each meeting shall have its own unique issue on the [Nautobot Community backlog](https://github.com/nautobot/community/issues). These issues will be created and managed by the Nautobot Core Team.

Please see the [issue for the very first meeting](https://github.com/nautobot/community/issues/1) as an example of how this will work.

### Agenda

The Nautobot Community meetings are meant to be a direct line of communication from the community to the Nautobot core development team. The emphasis of which will be a structured agenda to review open items (issues, PRs, ideas), hosted at a regular interval with the goal to garner feedback from the Nautobot community. It also allows the community to ask questions and collect feedback directly from the core development team.

#### Standard Agenda 

* Stale Pull Requests
* Upcoming Features
* New Ideas (that already have an Issue or Discussion Open)
* Open Discussion & Forum

#### Community Agenda Items

If anyone in the community would like to discuss a specific PR, feature, issue, or idea, please provide it as a comment to the GitHub issue for that specific meeting. This will ensure the meetings can stay time-boxed to the alloted time and to make sure that we can do our best to address everything.

### Meeting Notes

After each meeting, chat logs or other notes will be committed to the `meetings/` directory in this repository, named by ISO date. For example, `meetings/2021-09-30` would be the very first one we'll create.
